# Group Generator
This notebook takes in a list of students, any unwanted group configurations or past groups, number of members in each group, and number of weeks and returns a csv with dissimilar groups over the number of weeks. Dissimilarity in this instance means none of the groups will repeat more than two of the same members in a group.

The only real caveat is that I did not factor in when you have unequal numbers of group members.

Enjoy.
